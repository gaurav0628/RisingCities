RisingCities
Code for Rising Cities, an application with scratch implementations of Red Black Tree and Min Heap

**Introduction:**

Implementation of  Rising City application. It is implemented using Red Black Trees and MinHeap data structures. Structure of the project is based on a driver class named as risingCity.java. Data is taken as input from a text file and output is also written to the text file. Input file data has commands according to which actions are performed on the minheap and rbltree. For rbl tree implemented operations are insert and delete and for minheap implemented operations are insert and extract min. Checks are placed to ensure the sanctity of the data structure remains after each and every step.

**Complexity of the Operations:**

Print Building takes O(log n) time for a single node where n is the total number of
buildings

Printing Building Range takes time O(log n + S) where n is the total number of buildings
and S is buildings printed.

All of the other operations work in O(log n) time.
